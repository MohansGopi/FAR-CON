# FAR-CON
FAR-CON is an online store. I created it for a startup competition; unfortunately, I was not chosen, but the erperice is excellent. I learnt a lot of things in that competition, obviously technical stuff, and it was a fantastic exposure for meee...

The website was created using the Python library flask, and I then integrated several features such as a search algorithm....!
